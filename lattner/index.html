        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p class="work-text">
            Founded in 2014 as a solution for urban journeys, it was soon rightfully dubbed as Iran’s Uber. 
            Four years later, the Snapp! application turned into a super app, and now it offers numerous services ranging from requesting cabs & trucks, ordering food, reserving hotels and flights, buying inter-city bus and plane tickets, and all other services of Snapp! Group. 
            The Passenger service with more that 2 million daily rides is by far the most popular service.

            <p class="work-text">
                However, the Passenger experience remains the focal point of the application, as it is still the only part developed natively in Swift and UIKit. Some of its most important features include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Select pickup and drop-off coordinates</li>
                    <li>Select ride options such as waiting time or round-trip and see the corresponding price</li>
                    <li>See the driver’s (link?) location on the map in real time</li>
                    <li>Chat with the driver</li>
                    <li>Pay ride price</li>

            <p class="work-text-normal">
                When I joined Snapp! in 2017 as an iOS Developer, the app was written in Objective-C using MVC architecture. Since Snapp! is based on a real-time event system, MVC was not a suitable architecture and we were facing a lot of delays when implementing new features and also had a lot of problems finding root causes of bugs.

            <!-- <h2>Wireframes</h2> -->
            <p class="work-text-normal">
                So we decided to rewrite the application using Swift and a new architecture.
                You can read about the reasons behind this decision <a href="https://behdad.medium.com/we-decided-to-re-write-snapp-heres-why-8fcd89d7f49a" target="_blank">here</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                In order to select a new architecture, I studied all the common iOS app architectures out there: <a href="https://www.objc.io/issues/13-architecture/viper" target="_blank">VIPER</a>, <a href="https://github.com/uber/RIBs" target="_blank">Uber RIBs</a>, <a href="https://www.objc.io/issues/13-architecture/mvvm" target="_blank">MVVM</a>, and <a href="https://clean-swift.com/clean-swift-ios-architecture" target="_blank">Clean Swift</a>. 
                None of them actually worked for us for various reasons. We could’ve used RIBs as Snapp! and Uber apps are basically the same, but back then Uber hadn’t released much about RIBs other than a few videos and a blog post. They open-sourced RIBs a few months after we released our new app. So, the only choice left was to create a new architecture based on the learnings from those architectures. We called it SNPArchitecture and you can read about it <a href="https://github.com/behdaad/SNPArchitecture" target="_parent">here</a>.

            <!-- <h2>Final design</h2> -->
            <p class="work-text-normal">
                I kickstarted the rewrite project in December 2017 and started to grow the team. By August 2018 the project was done and the team grew to four developers with acting as the Tech Lead. We successfully launched the new app with a rebranded identity to massive success. This new architecture became the stepping stone for the transition of the app to a super app. The team also used SNPArchitecture to rewrite the Snapp! Driver app as well, again to huge success among Driver users. You can read about the Driver app <a href="../driver">here</a>.

            <p class="work-text-normal">We ran a survey again after releasing Change Destination to check both
                accessibility and usability.
                The results were positive and it scored a total of 91% for the accessibility and usability, and 79% for
                driver awareness of this feature. <br/>
                Also we checked our CC calls regarding change destination requests and it has reduced the calls.
