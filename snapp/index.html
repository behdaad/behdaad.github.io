                Founded in 2014 as a solution for urban journeys, it was soon rightfully dubbed as Iran’s Uber, reaching more than 1 million daily rides in 2017. 
                Four years later, the Snapp<span class="exclamation">!</span> application turned into a super app, and now it offers numerous services ranging from requesting cabs & trucks, ordering food, reserving hotels and flights, buying inter-city bus and plane tickets, and all other services of Snapp<span class="exclamation">!</span> Group. 
                The Cab service with more than 2 million daily rides is by far the most popular.

                Even though Snapp<span class="exclamation">!</span> offers many services, the Ride experience remains the focal point of the application, 
                as it is still the only part developed natively in <strong>Swift</strong> and <strong>UIKit</strong>. Some of its most important features include selecting pickup and drop-off coordinates, seeing the Driver’s location on the map in real-time, chatting with the Driver and selecting precise pickup location in airports.

                After the success of the Snapp<span class="exclamation">!</span> brand with the Cab service, all other sister companies rebranded using Snapp<span class="exclamation">!</span> in their names. Some of those companies include:

            <p class="work-text">
                Since the Snapp<span class="exclamation">!</span> Passenger app was widely downloaded and installed, it was a business decision to use the Passenger app as the gateway to all other services. Therefore we transformed the app to include a home page whose contents were dynamically filled using an API.

            <h2>Rewrite Project</h2>
            <p class="work-text">
                When I joined Snapp<span class="exclamation">!</span> in 2017 as an iOS Developer, the app was written in Objective-C using MVC architecture. Since Snapp<span class="exclamation">!</span> is based on a real-time event system, MVC was not a suitable architecture and we were facing a lot of delays when implementing new features and also had a lot of problems finding root causes of bugs.
                <br/>
                Moreover, this coincided with the rebranding of Snapp<span class="exclamation">!</span>, so we thought it was best we rewrote the whole app. You can read about the reasons behind this decision <a href="https://behdad.medium.com/we-decided-to-re-write-snapp-heres-why-8fcd89d7f49a" target="_blank">here</a>.

            <h2>New Architecture</h2>
            <p class="work-text-normal">
                So we decided to rewrite the application using <strong>Swift</strong> and new architecture.
            </p>
            <p>
                In order to select new architecture, I studied all the common iOS app architecture out there: <a href="https://www.objc.io/issues/13-architecture/viper" target="_blank">VIPER</a>, <a href="https://github.com/uber/RIBs" target="_blank">Uber RIBs</a>, <a href="https://www.objc.io/issues/13-architecture/mvvm" target="_blank">MVVM</a>, and <a href="https://clean-swift.com/clean-swift-ios-architecture" target="_blank">Clean Swift</a>. 
                None of them actually worked for us for various reasons. We could’ve used RIBs as Snapp<span class="exclamation">!</span> and Uber apps are basically the same, but back then Uber hadn’t released much about RIBs other than a few videos and a blog post. They open-sourced RIBs a few months after we released our new app. So, the only choice left was to create new architecture based on the learnings from those architecture. We called it SNPArchitecture and you can read about it <a href="https://github.com/behdaad/SNPArchitecture" target="_blank">here</a>.

            <p class="work-text-normal">
                I kickstarted the rewrite project in December 2017 and started to grow the team. By August 2018 the project was done and the team grew to four developers and I was acting as the Tech Lead. We successfully launched the new app with a rebranded identity to massive success. This new architecture became the stepping stone for the transition of the app to a super app. The team also used SNPArchitecture to rewrite the Snapp<span class="exclamation">!</span> Driver app as well, again to huge success among Driver users.
