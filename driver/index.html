                    Founded in 2014 as a solution for urban journeys, it was soon rightfully dubbed as Iran’s Uber, reaching more than 1 million daily rides in 2017.
                    Four years later, the Snapp<span class="exclamation">!</span> application turned into a super app, and now it offers numerous services ranging from requesting cabs & trucks, ordering food, reserving hotels and flights, buying inter-city bus and plane tickets, and all other services of Snapp<span class="exclamation">!</span> Group.
                    The Cab service with more than 2 million daily rides is by far the most popular.

                <h2>Rewrite Project</h2>
                <p class="work-text">
                    After the successful launch of the <a href="../snapp/">rewritten Passenger app</a>, we decided to do the same for the Driver app. The Driver app was also written in Objective-C using MVC architecture. Since Snapp<span class="exclamation">!</span> is based on a real-time event system, MVC was not a a suitable architecture and we were facing a lot of delays when implementing new features and also had a lot of problems finding root causes of bugs.
                    <br />
                    Moreover, this coincided with a complete overhaul of the app from design and usability standpoints, thus a perfect opportunity to let go of legacy code.

                <h2>A New Architecture</h2>
                <p class="work-text-normal">
                    So we decided to rewrite the application using <strong>Swift</strong> and new architecture.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to select a new architecture, I studied all the common iOS app architectures out there: <a href="https://www.objc.io/issues/13-architecture/viper" target="_blank">VIPER</a>, <a href="https://github.com/uber/RIBs" target="_blank">Uber RIBs</a>, <a href="https://www.objc.io/issues/13-architecture/mvvm" target="_blank">MVVM</a>, and <a href="https://clean-swift.com/clean-swift-ios-architecture" target="_blank">Clean Swift</a>.
                    None of them actually worked for us for various reasons. We could’ve used RIBs as Snapp<span class="exclamation">!</span> and Uber apps are basically the same, but back then Uber hadn’t released much about RIBs other than a few videos and a blog post. They open-sourced RIBs a few months after we released our new app. So, the only choice left was to create a new architecture based on the learnings from those architectures. We called it SNPArchitecture and you can read about it <a href="https://github.com/behdaad/SNPArchitecture" target="_blank">here</a>.

                    I initiated the rewrite project in December 2018 and kept growing the team. By June 2019 the project was done and the team grew to twelve developers. We successfully launched the redesigned app with massive success, just like the <a href="../snapp">Passenger app</a>.
