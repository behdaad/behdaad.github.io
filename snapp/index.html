            <p class="work-text">
                Founded in 2014 as a solution for urban journeys, it was soon rightfully dubbed as Iran’s Uber, reaching more than 1 million daily rides in 2017. 
                Four years later, the Snapp<span class="exclamation">!</span> application turned into a super app, and now it offers numerous services ranging from requesting cabs & trucks, ordering food, reserving hotels and flights, buying inter-city bus and plane tickets, and all other services of Snapp<span class="exclamation">!</span> Group. 
                The Cab service with more than 2 million daily rides is by far the most popular.

                Even though Snapp<span class="exclamation">!</span> offers many services, the Ride experience remains the focal point of the application, 
                as it is still the only part developed natively in <strong>Swift</strong> and <strong>UIKit</strong>. Some of its most important features include selecting pickup and drop-off coordinates, seeing the Driver’s location on the map in real-time, chatting with the Driver and selecting precise pickup location in airports.

                After the success of the Snapp<span class="exclamation">!</span> brand with the Cab service, all other sister companies rebranded using Snapp<span class="exclamation">!</span> in their names. Some of those companies include:

            <ul class="frameworks">
                <li><a href="https://snappfood.ir" target="_blank">Snapp<span class="exclamation">!</span> Food</a>: Food delivery</li>

            </ul>
            <p class="work-text">
                Since the Snapp<span class="exclamation">!</span> Passenger app was widely downloaded and installed, it was a business decision to use the Passenger app as the gateway to all other services. Therefore we transformed the app to include a home page whose contents were dynamically filled using an API.

            <h2>Rewrite Project</h2>
            <p class="work-text">
                When I joined Snapp<span class="exclamation">!</span> in 2017 as an iOS Developer, the app was written in Objective-C using MVC architecture. Since Snapp<span class="exclamation">!</span> is based on a real-time event system, MVC was not a suitable architecture and we were facing a lot of delays when implementing new features and also had a lot of problems finding root causes of bugs.
                <br/>
                Moreover, this coincided with the rebranding of Snapp<span class="exclamation">!</span>, so we thought it was best we rewrote the whole app. You can read about the reasons behind this decision <a href="https://behdad.medium.com/we-decided-to-re-write-snapp-heres-why-8fcd89d7f49a" target="_blank">here</a>.

            <h2>A New Architecture</h2>
            <p class="work-text-normal">
                So we decided to rewrite the application using <strong>Swift</strong> and new a architecture.
            </p>
            <p>
                In order to select new a architecture, I studied all the common iOS app architectures out there: <a href="https://www.objc.io/issues/13-architecture/viper" target="_blank">VIPER</a>, <a href="https://github.com/uber/RIBs" target="_blank">Uber RIBs</a>, <a href="https://www.objc.io/issues/13-architecture/mvvm" target="_blank">MVVM</a>, and <a href="https://clean-swift.com/clean-swift-ios-architecture" target="_blank">Clean Swift</a>. 
                None of them actually worked for us for various reasons. We could’ve used RIBs as Snapp<span class="exclamation">!</span> and Uber apps are basically the same, but back then Uber hadn’t released much about RIBs other than a few videos and a blog post. They open-sourced RIBs a few months after we released our new app. So, the only choice left was to create a new architecture based on the learnings from those architectures. We called it SNPArchitecture and you can read about it <a href="https://github.com/behdaad/SNPArchitecture" target="_blank">here</a>.

            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p class="work-text-normal">
                I kickstarted the rewrite project in December 2017 and started to grow the team. By August 2018 the project was done and the team grew to four developers and I was acting as the Tech Lead. We successfully launched the new app with a rebranded identity to massive success. This new architecture became the stepping stone for the transition of the app to a super app. The team also used SNPArchitecture to rewrite the Snapp<span class="exclamation">!</span> Driver app as well, again to huge success among Driver users.
